*Dunlap's Daily Advertiser 4 Feb. 1792*

From the Newark Gazette.

Mr Woods,

We frequently hear of the robberies and murders committed by the Indians - that there is neither faith nor honesty among them - that notwithstanding their continued intercourse with those who call themselves Christians, they still remain uncivilized and ignorant of the great duties of society. How far an acquaintance with their civilised neighbours, who boast of superior knowledge and virtue, will have a tendency to reform their morals, and teach them lessons of probity, will in some measure appear from the complaints contained in the speeches of their Chiefs, delivered in Philadelphia October, 1790, herewith sent you. In these speeches there are many sentiments, which would do honor to a Cato; as they have not been published, I wish to see them in your useful paper, and I doubt not they will afford pleasure to many of your readers.

Yours,
Civic.

Fathers of the Quaker State,

OBEALE or CORNPLANT returns thanks to God for the pleasure he has in meeting you this day with six of his people.

Fathers,
Six years ago I had the pleasure of making peace with you, and at that time a hole was dug in the earth, and all contentions between my nation and you ceased, and were buried there.

At a Treaty then held at Fort Stanwix, between the Six Nations of Indians and the Thirteen Fires, three men from the Quaker State came to me, and traded with me for the purhcase of a large tract of land, upon the northern boundary of Pennsylvania, extending from Tioga to lake Erie, for the use of their warriors, I agreed for the sale of the same, and sold it to them for four thousand dollars. I begged of them to take pity on my nation, and not buy it forever. They said they would purchase it forever: but that they would give me further, one thousand dollars in goods when the leaves were ready to fall: And when I found that they were determined to have it, I agreed that they should have it. I then requested, as they were determined to have the land, to permit my people to have the game, and to hunt upon the same; which request they complied with, and promised me to have it put on record, that I and my people should have that privilege.

Fathers,
The Six Nations then requested that another talk might be held with the Thirteen Fires; which was agreed to, and a talk was afterwards held between them at Muskingum. Myself with three of my Chiefs attended punctually, and were much fatigued in endeavouring to procure the attendance of the other Nations, but none of them came to the Council Fire except the Delawares and the Wyandots.

Fathers,
At the same treaty the Thirteen Fires asked me on which side I would die; whether on their side, or on the side of those Nations who did not attend the Council Fire I replied, listen to me, Fathers of the thirteen fires; I hope you will consider how kindly your fathers were treated by our Fathers the Six Nations, when they first came into this coutnry: since which time you have become strong, insomuch that I now call you Father. In former days, when you were young and week I used to call you brother, but now I called you Father.

Father,
I hope you will take pity on one of your children, for I now inform you that I will die on your side. Now Father I hope you will make my bed strong.

Fathers of the Quaker State,
I speak but little now, but will speak more when the Thirteen Fires meet. I will only inform you further, that when I had finished my talk with the Thirteen Fires, General Gibson, who was sent by the Quaker State, came to the Fire, and said, that the Quaker State had bought of the Thirteen Fires, a tract of land, extending from the northern boundary of Pennsylvania at Connewango River, to Buffaloe Creek, on Lake Erie; and thence along the said Lake to the northern boundary of Pennsylvania aforesaid. Hearing this, I ran to my Father, and said to him, Father have you sold this land to the Quaker State? and he said, he did not know; it might have been done since he came there. I then disputed with Gibson and Mr. Butler, who was with him, about the same, and told them I would be satisfied if the line was run from Connewango River, through Chataughque Lake, to Lake Erie; for Gibson and Butler had told me, that the Quaker State had purchased the land from the Thirteen Fires; but that not withstanding the Quaker State had given to me one thousand dollars, in fine prime goods, which were ready for me and my people at Fort Pitt. We then agreed that the line should be run from Connewango River, thro' Chatanghque Lake, into Lake Erie; and that one half of the fish in Chatanghque Lake should be mine, and one half their's. They then said, as the Quaker State had purchased the whole from the Thirteen Fires, that the Thirteen Fires must pay back to the Quaker State the value of the remaining land. When I heard this, my mind was at ease and I was satisfied. I then proposed to give a half a mile square of land upon the line so agreed on, to a Mr. Hawthorne, who was an Ensign in General Harmer's army, and to a Mr. Britt, a Cadet, who acted as Clerk upon the occasion, and who I well knew by the name of Half Town, for the purpose of their dwelling there, to prevent any mischief being committed in future upon my people's lands. And I hope that the Quaker State, would, in addition thereto give them another half mile square, on their side of the line, so agreed on, for the same purposes expecting thereby, that the line so agreed upon would be known with sufficient certainty; and that no disputes would thereafter arise between my people and the Quaker State concerning it. I then went to my Father of the Thirteen Fires, and told him I was satisfied: And the coals being covered up, I said to my Children, you must take your course right through the woods to Fort Pitt.

When I was leaving Muskingum, my own son, who remained a little while behind to warm himself by the fire, was robbed of a rifle by one of the white men, who I believe to have been a Yankey. Myself with Mr. Joseph Nicholson, and a Mr. Morgan, then travelled three days together through the wilderness; but the weather being very severe, they were obliged to separate from me, and I sent some of my own people along with Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Morgan, as guides to conduct to Whelen. After I had separated from Mr. Nicholson and Mr. Morgan, I had under my charge one hundred and seventy persons of my own Nation, consisting of men, women and children, to doncut through the wilderness, through heaps of briars, and having lost our way, we, with great difficulty reached Whelen.

When we arrived there, being out of provisions, I requested of a Mr. Zane to furnish me and my people with bacon and flour to the amount of seventeen dollars, to be paid out of the goods belong to me and my people at Fort Pitt. Having obtained my request, I proceeded on my journey to Pittsburg, and about ten miles from Wheelen my party were fired upon by three white men, andone of my people in the rear of my party received two shot through his blanket.

Fathers,

It was a constant practice with me, throughout the whole of my journey to take great care of my people, and not suffer them to commit any outrages, or drink more than what their necessities required. During the whole of my journey only one accident happened, which was owing to the kindness of the people of the town called Catfish, in the Quaker State: who, while I was talking with the head men of the town, gave to my people more liquor than was proper, and some of them got drunk, which obliged me to continue there with my people all night; and in the night my people were robbed of three rifles and one shot gun, and though every endeavour was used by the head men of the town, upon complaint made to them, to discover the perpetrators of the robbery, they could not be found; and on my people's complaining to me, I told them it was their own fault by getting drunk.

Fathers,

Upon my arrival at Fort-Pitt, I saw the goods which I had been informed of at Muskingum, and one hundred of the blankets were all moth-eaten and good for nothing. I was advised not to take the blankets, but the blankets which I and my people then had, being all torn by the briars in our passage through the wilderness, we were under the necessity of taking them to keep ourselves warm; and what most surprised me was that after I had received the goods, they extinguished the fire, and swept away the ashes; and having no interpreter there, I could talk to no one upon the subject.

Feeling myself much hurt upon the occasion, I wrote a letter to you, Fathers of the Quaker State, complaining of the injury, but never received any answer. Having waited a considerable time, and having heard that my letter got lost, I wrote a second time to you, Fathers of the Quaker State and then I received an answer. I am very thankful to have received this answer, and as the answer entreated me to come and speak for myself, I thank God that I have this opportunity. I therefore speak to you as follows:

I hope that you, Fathers of the Quaker State, will fix some person at Fort Pitt to take care of me and my people. I wish , and it is the wish of my people, if agreeable to you that my present Interpreter, Joseph Nicholson, may be the person; as I and my people have a confidence in him, and are satisfied that he will always exert himself to preserve peace and harmony between you and us. My reasons for wishing an Interpreter to be placed there, are that often times when any hunters and people come there, their canoes and other things are stolen, and they can obtain no redress, not having any person there on whom they can rely to interpret for them, and see justice done to them.

Fathers of the Quaker State,

About a year ago a young man, one of my tribe, who lived among the Shawanese, was on a party who had committed some outrages and stolen a quantity of skins the property of a David Duncan, being at Fort Pitt, was seized by the white people there, who would have put him in confinement and perhaps to death, had not some of the chiefs of the Seneca Nation interfered and bound themselves to the said David Duncan, who insisted upon satisfaction, for the payment of the sum of five hundred and thirty dollars for the said skins so stolen, upon which the young man was released and delivered to them.

Fathers of the Quaker State,
I wish now to acquaint you with what happened to one of my people about four years ago, four miles above Fort Pitt. A young man who was married to my wifes sister, when he was a hunting was murdered by a white man, there were three reasons for his being killed. In the first place, he had a fine riding horse. Secondly, he was richly dressed, and had about him a good deal of silver: and thirdly, he had with him a very fine rifle. The white man invited him to his house to alight from his horse: and he was getting off his horse, his head being rather down, the white man struck him with a tomahawk and killed him; and having plundered him, dragged him into the river. Upon the discovery of the murder, my people with Mr Nicholson and Mr Duncan had a great deal of trouble, and took a great deal of pain to find out the person who had committed the murder, and after three days searching, discovered him.

Fathers of the Quaker State,
About five years ago, one of my Chiefs named Half Town, was sent to Fort Pitt, to deliver up into your hands your own flesh and blood, who had been taken in the war; and before he returned two horses were stolen from him by the white people.

Now Fathers, I wish to inform you of another accident which happened to my people last winter, fifteen miels below Fort Pitt. My nephew with a hunting party being there was shot through the head in Mr. Nicholson's camp the particulars of which Mr Nicholson, who is present, can inform you of

Fathers,

I beg of you once more not to let such bad people be near me. And Fathers you must not think that I or any of my people are bad or wish evil to you or yours; nor must you blame us for mischiefs that have been committed by other nations.

Fathers,

Consider me and my people, and the many injuries we have sustained by the repeated robberies, and in the murders and depredations committed by the whites against us.

It is my wish, and teh wish of my people to live peacably and quietly with you and yours; but the losses we have sustained require some compensation. I have, with the consent of my people, agreed to receive from you eight hundred and thirty dollars as a satisfaction for all losses and injuries, I and my people have sustained; and this being paid me by you, to enable me to satisfy such of my people as have sustained those losses and suffered those injuries, we shall I hope in future live peaceably together, and bury in the earth all ill will and enmity to each other.

Fathers of the Quaker State

I have now had the pleasure to meet you with six of my people: we have come a great way by your desire to talk with you and to show you the many injuries my nation has sustained. It now remains with you to do with me and my people what you please, on account of the present trouble which I and my people have taken for your satisfaction, and in complaince with your request.

Fathers,

Having come this great way at your request and as it is necessary for some of us to remain here to talk with the Thirteen Fires when they meet, I have concluded to send back four of my people, and to remain here myself, with Half Town and my Interpreter Mr Nicholson until that time, which I hope you will approve of; but should you not approve of it, I must be under the necessity of returning with the whole of my people, which will be attended with considerable expence.

Fathers of the Quaker State,

You have now got the most of our lands and have taken the game upon the fame; we have only the privilege of hunting and fishing thereon. I therefore would make this further request, that a store may be established at Fort Pitt for the accommodation of my people and the other nations when they go out to hunt and where they may purchase goods at a reasonable price; for believe me Fathers you yourselves would be frightened were you to know the extravangant prices we are obliged to pay for the goods we purchase.

There is a man (Squire Wackle [undecipherable]) In Pittsburgh who has taken a great deal of pain to serve my people and has pittied them; my people when here were[unclear] kindly treated by him and give him a great deal of trouble; but he thinks nothing of it; He is the man my people wish should have the charge of the store.

Fathers of the Quaker State,

I have heard that you have been pleased to present to me a tract of land, but as yet I have seen no writings for the same. Well, Fathers if it be true that you have given me this tract of land, I can only thank you for the same, but I hope you will also give me tools and materials for working the same.

Fathers of the Quaker State,

Five years ago, when I used to be with my present interpreter, Joseph Nicholson, he took care of me and my people. Considering his services, and the difficulties he underwent in his journey from Muskingum to Fort Pitt the Six Nations wished to have him seated upon a tracted of land six miles square. lying in the forks of Alleghany river and Broken Straw creek; and accordingly patented the same to him: This being the place where a battle was fought between my people and yours; and where about thirty of my people were beaten by him and twenty five of your peoples and there he was shot through the thigh.

Now, Fathers, it is my wish, and I tell you it is the wish of the whole Six Nations in behalf of whom, and myself, I request that you would grant and confirm to one brother and friend, the before met[unclear] Joseph Nicholson, the aforesaid tract of land, as defined in our patent or grant to him.

This Fathers is all I have to say to the Quaker stat,e and I hope you will consider well of all that I have mentioned.
